# About myself....
I am an applied researcher in Artificial Intelligence working on EdTech, urban computing, smart cities and Big Data for Social Good. I strongly believe that Big Data/AI is the next frontier for innovation and will change the way societies operate from an expert-base approach to a data-driven approach. Apart from research in Big Data I am also very interested in technology transfer and IPR, as the main means of producing a social impact from research results.

Currently I work as a Principal Researcher at UNIR-iTED (Research Institute for Innovation and Technology in Education). Before that I worked at Telefonica Research, for the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) , for the Department of Information Systems & Computing of Brunel University in London, and last by not least for the Department of Computer Science @ Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

I have received a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, where I was the recipient of the Best Ph.D. Thesis Award of the School of Computer Science.
